# Oasis_Infobyte_Internship
This reposition is created to upload all my internship tasks which have been assigned to me during my internship at Oasis Infobyte.
## Task 1-Iris Classification
### Preview of Dataset:
- There are 150 observations with 4 features each (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).
- There are no null values, so we don't have to worry about that.
- There are 50 observations of each species (setosa, versicolor, virginica).

### Model:
- XGBoost is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed for efficient and scalable training of machine learning models. 
- It is an ensemble learning method that combines the predictions of multiple weak models to produce a stronger prediction. 
- XGBoost stands for “Extreme Gradient Boosting” and it has become one of the most popular and widely used machine learning algorithms due to its ability to handle large datasets and its ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance in many machine learning tasks such as classification and regression.

### Accuracy-
With XGB Classifier, our model received *100%* accuracy.
